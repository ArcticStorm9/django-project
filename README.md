# Django Project: Pred Builder

This is a, previously, fully deployed web app I developed. For security reasons, AWS files are not included in this repository.

### Project Goals:

Create a pseudo-social media for sharing builds and loadouts for the upcoming game Predecessor. This includes creating, sharing, and storing builds. Due to time constraints, I did not complete the entire implementation of the site, however the given repo is a fully functioning version. Alongside the social aspects, this includes an authentication using Oauth2 with the application discord.
